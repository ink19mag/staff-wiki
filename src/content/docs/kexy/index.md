### What is Kexy?

The Content Management System (CMS) used by ink19.com to prepare and publish text and images is called "Kexy". This is an old English word meaning "dry, hollow, brittle". It was picked out of a list of outdated words in the English language, always a good source of names for software projects. There have been several iterations of the Ink 19 CMS, but not much in the way of record-keeping. This would be the fifth or sixth version of such a system.
