### What is Mastodon? What is Room 19?

You can think of Mastodon as a networked, open-source version of Twitter. Each Mastodon server (Room 19 is one of them) works a lot like Twitter — its members post short bits of text, images, and links, and other members can comment, share, and otherwise engage with them. Unlike commercial social media sites, Mastodon (and Room 19) can communicate with other sites, so you can follow and interact with people on a different Mastodon site, and they can do the same with you.

### What do I do next?

Log in to your Room 19 account with the information above, and complete your profile. We recommend updating your password as well. You will also have received a separate email from the server asking you to confirm your email address; your account will not be active until you do this.

### Who should I follow on Room 19?

- **[@ink19](https://room19.com/@ink19)** - The official Ink 19 account
- **[@ink19_opps](https://room19.com/@ink19_opps)** - Recently posted opportunities for Ink 19 staff
- **[@rose](https://room19.com/@rose)** - Rose Petralia, your fearless managing editor
- **[@music_news](https://room19.com/@music_news)** - A curated news feed of links on other sites
- **[@music_news_feed](https://room19.com/@music_news_feed)** - The full news feed of links on other sites... this one posts a lot

### What can I do on Room 19?

If you have used social media before, you probably have a good idea about some of the things you can do in Room 19. Additionally, because it is integrated with Ink 19's staff site, you can do the following:

**Request an opportunity** — When you favorite a post on the **@ink19_opps** account, you also register a request to review or write about that opportunity, the same as you would when clicking on the “Request” button on that opportunity on staff.ink19.com.

**Contribute to the Ink 19 News Feed** — You can add a post on the **@music_news_feed** account to the Ink 19 news feed, which is featured on the home page and archived daily. To do this, reply to a post in the music news feed with `/post keyword1, keyword2`. You should add keywords corresponding to the news item, properly capitalized and separated by commas if there is more than one. At least one keyword is required.

### Why is Ink 19 doing this?

The primary intent behind the creation of Room 19 is to build a social space for the music obsessives that make up our staff, and by extension, our readership. For most of its history online, [ink19.com](http://ink19.com/) has been a strictly expository website, presenting content for its visitors but not providing a way for readers to comment on an article, or start a conversation with its author.

This decision was made mostly out of the desire attract readers who are interested in the articles we write and not argumentative trolls, but it does limit engagement from those readers and hampers building out the community that should be developing around these shared interests. We are hoping that by establishing Room 19 as an integrated but separate space for discussion, we can find some working compromise.

Additionally, we are hoping to use some of the platform's functionality to build new features into our website. The @music_news_feed aggregator is a good example. It reads the RSS feeds of several sites that publish music news items, and then makes a post for each item on the account’s feed. Ink 19 staff can then select the items they find interesting and relevant as they show up on their feed, and with a single click mark them for publication on the home page. All of this is something that we could implement as a new feature to the staff site, but it is more efficient to use Mastodon, in terms of developing an interface to display news items and allow someone to select which ones to highlight, and also as a general user experience where it can be done casually as part of your interactions with Room 19 rather than as a task where you go to the staff site and look at news items to approve.

This is all an experiment, which is not to say that we are not committed, but rather that we are not sure what is going to happen and have to be ready to adjust and try new variations. All ideas and feedback from staff are welcome!
