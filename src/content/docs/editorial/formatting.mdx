Markdown syntax and "Quicktags" format article text and paragraphs in our published content. In general, you will not have to enter Quicktags yourself &mdash; article parts such as headline, byline, body, etc. are tagged when you submit a draft. Once they are in place, they can be left alone, unless you need some very specific formatting changes.

Note that formatting from Word or other programs __does not transfer__ to our article forms.

## Quicktags Overview

Every paragraph in your reviews starts with a Quicktag. Quicktags determine the formatting of each paragraph, with one completely blank line between paragraphs. 

## Formatting Options

Apply formatting to all or part of a text block.

1. __Entire paragraphs__ require only a Quicktag (two-letter block tag preceded by a hyphen and followed by one space) to apply the correct formatting to the paragraph: `-bm `
3. __Image formatting__ does not need a Quicktag. On a blank line, type the image title surrounded by double brackets: `[[Example Image]]`.  
2. __Special text formatting__ within a paragraph, such as __bold text__ or _italics_ or hyperlinks, are handled using [Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax).  

### 1. Text Formatting  

- Italicize by surrounding text with underscores, `_like this_`. 
- Make text bold by using double underscores, `__like this__` .
- Put website labels in square brackets followed immediately with the URL in parentheses: `[Ink 19 Home](https://ink19.com)`.


### 2. Image formatting

- The Images Manager in the article form is where uploads, alignment, captions, and credits are set. Image uploads are typically managed by the editors.
- Inserting an image into an article only specifies its location within the article. To insert an uploaded image into an article, surround the title in double brackets ``[[uploaded_image.jpg]]`` or ``[[A Nicely Titled Image]]`` and place it in its own paragraph, with one completely blank line above and below. The text will be replaced with the image and its associated captions.

## Quicktags

- Each Quicktag adds specific CSS Class formatting to the paragraph.
- Add a hyphen before and a space after Quicktags (`-bf `), and be sure the hyphen is the first character of the line.
- See commonly used Quicktags below!
