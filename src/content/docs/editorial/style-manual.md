# General

We apply these guidelines to everything _Ink 19_ publishes, from the shortest record reviews to the most extensive features. 

## Language

_Ink 19_ covers *everything*, but use vulgarity only when it's really needed&mdash;pointed use of earthy language can drive a point home, but overuse is unimaginative. Direct quotes are exempt. Please note that we use the actual word and not a symbolic equivalent. Example: "fuck," not "f**k." 

We're inclusive. Use people's preferred pronouns, don't assume gender, be respectful, and do not be mean.

## Accuracy & Plagiarism

Publishing content that is untrue, misleading, or inaccurate helps no one and could leave the magazine open to litigation. Research your material. Names, titles, facts, and details should be confirmed before submitting articles. Check, check, and double-check. You are responsible for the accuracy of your content.

Taking credit for other creators' works is plagiarism and is not tolerated at _Ink 19_. When quoting others' words or works in your stories, give credit to the creators and link to the source material. There are no exceptions.

## Spelling & Grammar

Check your spelling! Read what you write! Nobody needs to be perfect, but copy editors&mdash;and our audience&mdash;need to be able to clearly understand your words, and reading your content before submitting can get you a little closer to perfect. Brush up on punctuation, subject-verb agreement, and comma placement rules (less is more) if it's been a while. We appreciate it!
