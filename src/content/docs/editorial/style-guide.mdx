Copy editing aims to check spurious facts, spelling, and grammar, and to provide style consistency within each article and across _Ink 19_. It's a high aim.

Writers should double check their own work before submitting for copy editing.

- Spell everyone's names correctly &mdash; let's not insult the artists we are reviewing.
- Read your final story and correct any errors in spelling, capitalization, and grammar. 
- Check [Quicktags](formatting) and other formatting.
- Include a real URL in the article form.
- Add a featured image.
- Double check the publicist's email address.


## Basics

- [Purdue Online Writing Lab](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/grammar/index.html) is a good resource.
- __Plurals never need apostrophes__.
- Apostrophes replace what you're deleting: '70s.
- We rock the Harvard comma (Mike D, Ad-Rock, __and__ MCA).
- __Commas go inside the quotes__ ("She's Crafty," "Girls," and "No Sleep 'Til Brooklyn").
- Do not be tempted to run two, three, or four sentences together, as one.
- Use the HTML for em dashes  `&mdash;`   sparingly for emphasis.
- Album, movie, play, and book titles (large works) are italic: `_Paul's Boutique_`.
- Song, chapter, and episode titles (parts of works) are in quotes: "She's Crafty."
- There is never any need to use bold or underline in a story, make use of your own words to emphasize.
- Capitalize album titles the way they are on the recording.


## Writing

- Is it interesting?
- Did you use real words, make a point, have something to say?
- Does the review give relevant details and include enough to give an idea of the full material?


## A Note about Rights

- _Ink 19_ doesn't generally publish stories that have already run elsewhere (other print or online magazines, Amazon.com, other review sites). If you have a question, [ask an editor](mailto:editors@ink19.com).
- Once your story runs on _Ink 19_, it's your story. You can do what you like with it. We do ask that you credit the original _Ink 19_ article wherever possible: "originally appeared on ink19.com on \<date\>" or similar is sufficient.
