## New Music Now

_Ink 19_’s _New Music Now_ spotlights the songs we can't get out of our heads. _Ink 19_ hosts exclusive conversations with artists about our favorite new albums.

Each _NMN_ episode features three people: an _Ink 19 host_, a musically-interested guest, and a guest musician. Each of these people talks about 2 tracks from a new album they love, and our musical guests also talk about 2 tracks from their own upcoming or new release.
