With contributors all over the world and a variety of technologies in the mix, we could have a potential mess of duplicated stories, frustrated efforts, and general confusion, but we don't. What we do have is a time-tested process for requesting and reviewing materials, attending events, and writing stories for _Ink 19_. Familiarity with the process really helps as you get started. 

- Materials come through the [Ink 19 Opportunities](https://staff.ink19.com/opportunities/) list. Scroll through or search for something interesting, then click the request button.

- Look for your _tentative_ assignment in your email, on the [Assignments](https://staff.ink19.com/assignments) page, and on your staff Dashboard. 

- __You will confirm your assignment when you have materials / passes, and not before__.

- Most opportunities include streaming or download links &mdash; these are strictly for reviewers and cannot be shared. If materials are not included, first leave a comment in your assignment for the Editor requesting what you need. 

- If you contact a publicist through your assignment email or anytime on behalf of _Ink 19_, __copy editors@ink19.com so we know what's going on__. Often, editors already have review materials or are in touch with publicists about them. 

- Once you have the details and material for your assignment, head back to your Dashboard or the Assignments tab to __confirm__ your assignment and write your draft. 

- If you need help with the website or story forms, [send us an email](mailto:editors@ink19.com). If something comes up and you can't write your review, let us know, so we can let you off the hook and reassign materials. 

5. Please submit thorough, accurate, and proofread articles. Editors decide when and whether a story is ready to publish and may return stories to the writer for corrections or tightening up. 

6. This may seem obvious, but we'll be explicit here: __plagiarism is not okay, and only the contributor's original content is considered for publishing on _Ink 19_.__ Don't claim credit for another creator's works, including photographs, or risk being banished from a pretty cool magazine and potentially prosecuted. Don't do it.

 7. Once your story is posted and submitted, it gets proofed, edited, and scheduled before appearing on [ink19.com](https://ink19.com) and our social media.

8. You're encouraged to share any _Ink 19_ story on your own social media. Include us however you'd like, but please do.
