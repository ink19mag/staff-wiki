## Who We Are

_Ink 19_ is the publisher, editors, writers, photographers, designers, and creators who work together to publish original, thought-provoking reviews of a variety of genres and media on ink19.com. Our Publisher / Owner, Ian Koss, focuses on tech and vision. Editor Rose Petralia manages day-to-day operations and staff onboarding. Frank Dreyer designs our looks.

We are all-volunteer, all the time, and while contributing will not afford anyone financial freedom, we are a great place to gain an audience, practice a craft, and work within a creative, professional community. We make this point often, apologies.

## What We Do

Some of us have been at _Ink 19_ since we started up in 1991, and we welcome new writers and artists all the time. We have no specific editorial bias and encourage staff to pursue creative interests, giving the magazine a leading edge on new music, artists, and movements. 

We coordinate with publicists and artists to bring new music, films, books, shows, and all kinds of media to you, our contributors, and then we publish your reviews at ink19.com. Advances are typically streaming or downloaded, strictly for the reviewer's use only, and not to be shared with anyone. Digital and physical review materials are yours to keep.

We expect honesty in our reviews but don't take cheap shots. Tastes may change over time, but honesty never goes out of style, and people come to recognize our writers as Trusted Voices. That's exactly what we want. 

We reserve the right to reject any work that does not meet editorial standards. While we are mindful of our all-volunteer staff, we are committed to quality content that we can all take pride in.
