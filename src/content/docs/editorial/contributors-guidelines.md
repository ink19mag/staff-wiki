_Ink 19_ is an all-volunteer organization and a great place to gain exposure, practice your chops, and work with a community of talented people in an environment of creative expression. It will not afford you financial freedom. We make this point often, so we apologize in advance for the redundancy. 

We know creators work best when they have a good idea of everyone's expectations. This staff guide should help with understanding our standards and editorial process. 

## Who We Are

"We" are the _Ink 19_ publisher, editors, writers, photographers, graphic designers, and other creators who work together to publish original, thought-provoking reviews in a variety of genres and media. Publisher [Ian Koss](mailto:ian@ink19.com), Managing Editor [Rose Petralia](mailto:rose@ink19.com), All staff [Ink 19 Staff](https://ink19.com/staff). 

- **Copy Editors** understand many genres of music and can spot extra spaces and dangling modifiers.

- **Writers** have a good grasp of language and grammar, a clear opinion, and something to say. 

- **Photographers** know how to take and edit their own slick images.

- **Illustrators** employ humor and a unique style. 

- **Web Designers** design clean, efficient, modern, and relevant pages.

- **Web Programmers** is a misnomer&mdash;we only have one and sure could use some RedHat/PHP/mySQL jockeys. 

## What We Do Here

Some _Ink 19_ contributors have been writing together for over 20 years, and we welcome new contributors all the time. With no specific editorial bias, we encourage staff to pursue their personal  creative interests, giving the magazine a leading edge on new music, artists, and movements. 

We encourage honesty. Rave about the stuff worth raving about. Pointing out flaws is allowed too, but cheap shots are discouraged unless we think you're really good at it. Your tastes may change over time, but if you stay honest, people will come to recognize your name as a Trusted Voice. And that's exactly what we want. 

We expect submitted material to meet editorial standards, and reserve the right to reject any work. While we are mindful of our all-volunteer staff, we are committed to quality content that we can all take pride in.

## About Your Privacy

We will not divulge physical addresses or phone numbers to anyone outside of _Ink 19_, and any requests for your information will be forwarded to you. Your name, city-state-country, and other selected information may be seen by visitors to the site.
