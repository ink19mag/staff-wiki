Read below for some guidelines and hope for the future should your beautiful, high-res concert photos be sending you over the edge.

## Size and resolution

- If you are having trouble uploading images, it is most likely because they are too large.
- Resolution does not need to be print-quality for screen viewing. Try reducing resolution or size to get each image below 200K. JPGs are generally smaller than PNGs.
- Less is more. We don't need 35 shots of a sweaty drummer. 

## Uploading

- From the story View or Edit form, scroll to the Images box and click Add Image.
- In the Source File section, click Browse to find your image on your computer, select it, and hit Enter on your keyboard (or click Open in the dialog box).
- In the Image Name box, type the name of your photo. This name should be unique, and not appear elsewhere in the text of your story. The name you give your image in no way reflects its file type.
- Add Credit and Caption.
- Set alignment. For vertical photos, choose left or right. For wide photos, choose center.
- Click Save.

You should now see a preview of your image in the uploader dialog&mdash;if you do not, most likely your image is too large. Reduce its file size to below 200K, and try again.

## Inserting

In the story form, enter your image name on its own line (one clear line above and below), surrounded by double brackets: `[[image.jpg]]`.

## Help

If youâ€™re unsure about where to place your images, or if you cannot get your images to upload, [contact an editor](contact).
