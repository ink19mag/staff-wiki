*The copy editors will generally fix minor issues, but may send writers here to brush up.*

At a minimum, check for the following things in each article. When style diverges from the standard, such as using numerals instead of writing out numbers below ten, let it at least be consistent throughout the article.

- Compliance with this style manual
- __Proper spelling of band, musician, play, actor, album, producer, artist, etc. names__. Let's not insult the people we are reviewing.
- Mechanics: errors in spelling, capitalization, grammar, sentence structure, agreement, etc.
- _Italicized_ album, film, TV show, book titles, `_like this_`
- Song, episode, chapter titles in "quotes"
- Proper [Quicktags](formatting-quicktags) and other formatting
- Proper URLs at the end of articles, starting with either `http://` or `www`
- Multiple URLs separated with bullets (`<space>&bullet;<space>`)
- A relevant feature image
- Publicist email address

## Basics

- Plurals NEVER need apostrophes, and decades are no exception, unless they’re possessive or contracted: The 1970s.
- When contracting decades, the apostrophe goes before the numbers (it replaces what you’re deleting), like this: ’70s.
- Possessive decades follow the normal rule for possessives: I bought three copies of 1986′s _Licensed to Ill_ for my sisters.
- A band is a singular entity; a band’s members are plural. This is important for subject-verb agreement, which should not be rocket science to anyone here.
- Need a brush-up? [Purdue Online Writing Lab](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/index.html) is a decent resource.

## Commas and Semi-colons

- We rock the Harvard comma&mdash;insert a comma before the “and” in series of three or more (Mike D, Ad-Rock, and MCA).
- __Commas go inside the quotes__ (“She’s Crafty,” “Girls,” and “No Sleep ‘Til Brooklyn”).
- Semi-colons join two complete sentences; if one side of the semi-colon is not a complete sentence, use a comma and one of the _fanboys_ (for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so) instead.

- Do not be tempted to run two, three, or four sentences together, as one.

## Dashes and Hyphens

- Use the HTML for em dashes  `&mdash;`   sparingly for emphasis.
- Hyphenate compound adjectives, except those that end in -ly (high-energy setlist, butter-soft vocals, death-knell chorus, lo-fi dance beat, deliciously misconstrued, overly affectionate).

## Quotation Marks vs. Italics

- Album, movie, play, and book titles (large works) are formatted in italics: `_Paul’s Boutique_`.
- Song, chapter, and episode titles (parts of larger works) are surrounded by double quotes: “She’s Crafty” or the *Frazier* episode called “She’s the Boss.”

## Spelling and Capitalization

- WHEN THE PUBLICIST'S MATERIAL IS WRITTEN IN ALL-CAPS, __CHANGE IT TO Sentence Case__.
- Spell out numbers below eleven.
- Capitalize “The” in a band’s name only when it is an official part of the band name. Use the band’s official website to check.
- Capitalize album titles the way they are on the recording.

## Writing

- Is it interesting?
- Did the writer use real words, make a point, have something to say?
- Does the review give relevant details and include a number of tracks--enough to give an idea of the full material?

# About Our Copyediting

- Editors may leave a comment in an article when it would be useful for the writer to know or learn something about their writing mechanics or style. Don't blow off this guidance.
- Copy editors are here simply to make sure content is accurate and well-written. 
- The goal of copyediting is to improve the readers' experience, but we also respect individual voices and styles.
- Comments may be visible by author only, author and editors, or all staff and should be made only when necessary!

# A Note about Rights

- _Ink 19_ doesn’t generally publish stories that have already run elsewhere (other print or online magazines, Amazon.com, other review sites). If you have a question, [ask an editor](https://staff.ink19.com/wiki/staff/contact).
- Once your story runs on _Ink 19_, it’s your story. You can do what you like with it. We do ask that you credit the original _Ink 19_ article wherever possible: “originally appeared on ink19.com on XX/20XX” or similar is sufficient.
