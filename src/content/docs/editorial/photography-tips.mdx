*notes from Phil Bailey, Jen Cray, and Ian Koss*

## Show Up Prepared

- You need to have a camera. Your phone may have the ability to take pictures, but that does not make it a camera. If you don't have your own camera, find a friend willing to lend you one, and have them spend some time showing you how to use it. If it's been a while since you used a camera, practice beforehand.
- You should have the tour manager's name and phone number in case there are problems with your entry or photo pass. If there is a problem, be polite and persistent in your efforts to resolve it.
- It is a guarantee that one day, you will not be allowed to shoot a concert despite everyone else's best efforts. When that happens, do not make a scene. Notify the person who set up the shoot the next day, and they will make a scene on your behalf, to the people that matter.

## Be Professional

- Remember that you are representing _Ink 19_, and your actions will affect not just your future coverage, but that of all other _Ink 19_ writers and photographers. 
- Respect any and all rules provided by the venue, band, or other authority. Don't be tempted to sneak backstage or use a flash when you've been specifically asked not to. 
- Establishing yourself as a professional that venue security staff don't have to babysit will make your life a whole lot easier photographing future shows at that venue.  In short, don't be a jerk.

## Get the Shot

- You have to get as close to the stage as possible &mdash; many venues have a security pit that press can access.
- If there's no security pit, get your butt up to the front. 
- Getting great shots can be tricky, but you need to follow the rules and be kind to those around you.

## Don't Shoot Straight

- Take a step or two off-center instead of standing directly in front of your subject to avoid the clutter of mic stands and shadows on the face. 
- Stand to the left of stringed instrument players, unless they're a lefty like Paul McCartney (then you'll step to the right). You want to be on the side away from the guitar neck and away from the front of the mic stand.

## Shoot Fast

- Slow shutter speeds will ruin your pictures &mdash; use as fast a shutter speed as possible to get decent exposures.  
- It's easier to lighten a slightly dark picture than fix a blurry one.

## Stay Calm

- It can get really chaotic in the security pit at the front of the stage. With the crowd behind you, the band coming on stage in front of you, and security people and photographers all around, it's easy to become overwhelmed.
- Take advantage of the multiple subjects available. If there's a cluster of photographers around the lead singer or they have their back to the crowd, scoot over and shoot the bass player (they're in the band too). 

## Always Be Shooting

- Shoot a bunch of photos.  
- Try different settings as you go and check your screen occasionally to see what you're getting.  
- You're probably only going to get 2-3 songs to shoot, so make it count.

## Wear Earplugs

- Up against the stage is so much louder than just being in the room.  
- Always wear earplugs to protect your hearing.
