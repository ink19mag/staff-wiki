Premise: Ink 19’s current editorial design is geared towards the music-purchasing world of the twentieth century. The values and opinions expressed by Ink 19 staff are more valuable than ever, but the ways of delivering them need to be adjusted to the current media landscape.

- Integrate Spotify / other playlists with reviews where relevant
	- Add ability to search Spotify for album or track and link to music review.
	- Add highlight tracks / notes?
- Annotated playlists
	- See Sound Salvation
	- Commented by the author
	- Thematic
- Discovery playlists
	- Staff picks
	- Shorter reviews grouped together (stacks of 9? 3x3 “brady” style mosaic of covers?)
	- Listen to playlist while you read commentary (Liner Notes)
	- Less than 100 words
- Hosted playlists
	- See The Lacking Organization
	- Hosted by author
	- Radio show format
	- Southern Accents / Bovine Ska (?) / 2 Dub (?)
- Room 19 Podcast (separate doc)
- News and track / video premieres
- Screen/Columns (can we add more photo/video content to column spaces?  Thinking particularly in regards to Stroke of Midnight and TV Party that could function a bit more as “what to watch” similar to the music playlists but with film/tv)
