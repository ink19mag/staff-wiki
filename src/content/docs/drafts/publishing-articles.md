To publish an <em>Ink 19</em> story, follow these steps:

## 1. Meet Story Requirements

Make sure stories meet the following requirements.

### Properly composed and formatted text

It likely goes without saying, but text should be proofread and as free of spelling and grammar mistakes as possible. Take a break after writing, then return for a last pass through the text to make any corrections before sumitting.

### Description

Every story should have a description that includes the author's name as bold type. Columns may include the column title instead of author name.

### Correct section and subsection

Make sure the story and column sections are correct.

Music review subsections should be added by entering "Music X" in the subsection field, where "X" is the first letter of the review's index section. For example, "The Pixies" would be in "Music P," while "Robyn Hitchcock" would be in "Music H."

### Correct indexing, keywords, and cross-referencing

The "Index" field should contain the standard index entry for the story, similar to the index in the back of a textbook. For the examples above, use "Pixies, The" and "Hitchcock, Robyn" correspondingly.

You can also add additional keywords or cross-references, especially if none currently exist.

## 2. Check Off Media Assignment

This step is only applicable if review materials were sent to staff by <em>Ink 19</em>. Find the item in "Review Materials" and click on the bold link of the writer's name. This will mark the item as "Reviewed" and take it off the writer's assignment list.

## 3. Add Graphics

### Story Badge

All stories should have a custom badge if possible. The badge is the smallish square which is displayed alongside the story on the home page and in other indexes. Badges are exactly 125 pixels square, and should not be larger or smaller. In the case of columns, you do not need to add a badge; each column has a default badge it can use.

To add a badge, view the story and click on the "Add Badge" link toward the bottom. A new popup window should open. You can attach a file that's local to your computer, or if the image is online somewhere, enter its URL in the 'Source URL' field and the system will download the image.

The majority of badges will be used will be for record reviews. In this case, you can use the "Review Materials" section to locate a prepared badge. Right-click on the image link and select an appropriate menu item to open it in a new window or copy the image location to the clipboard. You can enter the image's URL in the 'Source URL' field on the badge popup.

### Other Graphics

All stories with the exception of record reviews and columns should be accompanied by appropriate graphics.

There are a couple of basic standards for sizing graphics. No graphic should be more than 400 pixels wide. Squarish graphics can be up to 200 pixels wide, and vertical graphics (ie book or DVD covers) should be 175 pixels wide.

Placing graphics on a story is a two-step process. First, attach all the graphics to the story by clicking the 'Add Image' link towards the bottom. A new popup window should open. Give the image a unique title (ie 'Napoleon Dynamite 1') and make sure its settings are correct -- give proper credit where due, and add any captioning as necessary. You can set the alignment to float to the image left or right of text, or center it.

Once you've attached the graphics to the story, edit the text and place the image titles in quotes where you wish for the images to appear, ie "Napoleon Dynamite 1" in the example above. If this doesn't sound too clear, take a look at the text previously published stories (in 'Edit' mode) to see how it works.

## 4. Scheduling

When the story is ready to publish, make sure it is released. If a story has not been released, it will have a 'Release' button towards the bottom. Once it is released, it will be listed in the 'Schedule' page, where you can assign it a date and time of publication. Dial in the desired date and time for the stories on the schedule which you wish to publish, and click on 'Save'.

Note that automatic publishing is not currently enabled. Once a story is supposed to be published, it will appear in the 'Pending Text' list. Click on the 'Publish Now' button at the bottom to render the stories to the site.

## 5. Checking Up

After stories have been rendered, you should visit http://www.ink19.com/ and check that all the stories have properly rendered.

# Priorities

While we try to schedule each issue as carefully and completely as possible, it's inevitable that we won't be able to run all the articles we receive. At this point, we call on a careful evaluation of competing articles, to be performed by the great mystical Judge of Oran, an impartial minor Ur-Force. Unfortunately, the Judge keeps weird hours, and we often find ourselves having to eliminate stories ourselves at the last minute. Here are some questions we ask ourselves -- each "yes" answer gives an article additional priority over others.

## General

**Was it scheduled?** Scheduled articles that we know about are chosen over articles that just show up on our doorstep.

**Does it require no extra work?** Well-written articles are chosen over ones which require serious work.

**Was it previously held over?** Generally, articles which were intended to run a previous month (but didn't) are chosen over newer articles.

**Is it local or regional?** Any article which features something from the Southeast will take precedence over something of a national scope.

**Is it urgent?** Articles whose timeliness is limited are chosen over articles that can wait another month.

## Features

**Does it fit in well?** We're looking for articles clearly related to the issue theme.

**Is it interesting?** Does it offer a different perspective on some aspect of the theme?

## Ink Spots

**Does it expire?** If an interview with a band has opportunity to run shortly before the band tours through town, we'll go out of our way to run it.

## Live Ink

**Is it fresh?** If you are submitting a review of a show two months after it took place, its chances of running are slim.

## Wet Ink

**Is it generally available?** Reviewing items of extremely limited availability (bootlegs, demos, ultra-rare imports, etc.) serves no purpose. If what you review can't be found at the local mall, and you can't supply an address, phone, or URL for contact, you might as well be reviewing something fictional.

**Has the author indicated a preference?** Those of you that write multiple reviews each month are requested to select one or two of the bunch that you would choose to cut if you had to. We always have more reviews than we have space for, so it's a simple fact of life that each month, some will be cut from print. You may use whatever criteria you like for this choice, and your cut reviews will run on the Web. This helps make the decision easier for us, and doesn't leave you wondering why your review was "relegated" to the Web.

# The Editorial Process

## A Brief Introduction to Scheduling and the _Ink 19_ Editorial Process

### Why Schedule? or "What Happened to My ______ Article?"

It's a hard fact of life that space in our print edition is at a premium. We've grown to the point where we have a lot of talented writers looking to place their work with us, and therefore, assigning and scheduling these articles has become more important than ever. What this means to you, the writer, is that you can't expect to send us an unsolicited article of any type and expect it to run in our print edition.

"So," you ask, "how do I get my work into the print edition?" The answer is simple. Schedule it! "How do I do that?" you ask? The first step (for most articles) is to drop a note to our Music Editor, Julio Diaz, at [julio@ink19.com](mailto:julio@ink19.com). Once you've got an article in the works (that you've either set up for yourself or have set up through _Ink 19_), you should immediately drop Julio a note. Julio will then give you the go-ahead (assuming that nobody else has already scheduled the same coverage) or let you know that you've inquired too late.

The process for our monthly themed "Features" is the same, with one important difference. On "Features", you'll be dealing with our Features Editor, James Mann, at [james@ink19.com](mailto:james@ink19.com).

If you have not received a go-ahead from the proper editor, your article is not scheduled. If you send in an article that has not been scheduled, we will consider it to run on our Web site ([http://www.ink19.com](http://www.ink19.com)), but 99% of the time, it will not run in print. This may seem harsh, but there are too many people that follow the rules, and we're not going to penalize them for doing so.

It should be noted that several writers are not concerned where their work runs. If you don't mind that your article will only run on our Web site, feel free to submit it unscheduled. We'd still prefer that you schedule it, but there is always plenty of room for quality articles on the Web. Additionally, if you'd like to specify that you want your work to be considered only for the Web, let us know.

### Deadlines

When the editor gives you the go-ahead, he'll also schedule the article for an upcoming issue, and advise you of the deadline. You'll always be reminded of this deadline as it approaches, both in a general deadline reminder note to the staff each month, and a personal note on your individual project(s) for the month. If you find yourself unable to meet a deadline, you must contact the editor ASAP. He will then either extend the deadline for you if possible, or reschedule the article for another issue, if necessary (in the case of Features, the theme changes monthly, so articles can't be rescheduled for another issue).

### Too... Many... Articles!

On the rare occasion that we overbook an issue, if your article gets pushed out of the print edition due to space constraints, we will contact you as soon as possible to discuss a solution. With "Ink Spots" (interviews), it's usually possible to run the article in the following issue, but "Wet Ink" media reviews (CDs, films, print, etc.), and "Live Ink" (live reviews) tend to be more time-sensitive material, and as such, are usually better off moved to the Web. Rest assured, though, that if you went through channels and scheduled the article, we will make every effort to resolve the situation to your satisfaction.

### OK, I'm done writing. Now what?

Once you've completed your article, you e-mail it to the appropriate editor (again, "Features" to James Mann, everything else to Julio Diaz). You should also CC a copy to [text@ink19.com](mailto:text@ink19.com). If you have accompanying artwork, that should be sent directly to our Image Editor, Phil Bailey, at [phil@ink19.com](mailto:phil@ink19.com). Please do not send artwork to the editors or to the text address.

Once you have sent in your article, your editor will proofread and review it. We will correct minor spelling and grammar errors, but if an article is riddled with errors of this type, we will send it back unread, and will not look at it until the writer has corrected the errors. There is no excuse for not running a spell-checker on your work.

### Well, the spelling's OK, but something is still missing...

If the article does not meet our standards for publication (see "General Standards" and "Guidelines by Section"), the editor will drop you a note to start a dialogue on rewrite. We're not here to rewrite your articles for you; however, we will make suggestions for improvement. Rewrites will be handled by the writer of the original article, in most cases; only in extremely rare cases (in the interest of getting to press on time) will an editor perform minor rewrites. Once we've discussed the issues, the editor will assign a deadline for the rewrite. If that deadline can't be met, the article will be rescheduled for another issue.

If rewrites are not resolving the problems, or if an article appears to be beyond hope of salvation, the editorial staff retains the right to reject the article altogether.

Editorial staff also retains the right to abridge your article for print if it is longer than space constraints will allow. In these cases, we will attempt to work with you to ensure the abridgement meets with your approval, if time allows. It's rare that we'll be able to run an article in excess of 2000 words unabridged, so if your article is longer, it may be a good idea to submit two versions -- a full text effort for our Web site, and a shorter version for print. Anytime an abridged article runs in print, we run the full, original text on the Web, and include a note at the close of the article directing readers to the site for the full version.

Please keep in mind that the editorial staff is always here to help you. If you're stuck on an article, or want us to take a look at a preliminary draft and make suggestions, or need some constructive criticism, we're glad to do so. Simply drop us a line.

## The Editorial Lifecycle

The responsibilities of an editor are many, but they are all touched upon through the life cycle of a story.

### 1\. A Story Is Born

Somehow, an idea for a story is created. Perhaps it comes from the posting of an opportunity on the staff site; it could also originate with a request from a writer, or an editor who decides something is worthy of coverage. Whatever the case, at this point a story is in a state of potential.

### 2\. Assignment

Nothing is official until there is an assignment. An editor makes an assignment when the following are clear and confirmed:

*   Writer
*   Section (event review, interview, review, other)
*   Availability of subject
*   Industry contact (if necessary)

In other words, it's not an assignment if we don't know exactly who's writing it and exactly what type of story to expect. Additionally, we want to know when the subject will be available (the date of the interview or show, for example) and have a specific contact in industry in the case of more complex stories. When all of this is in place, the assignment takes place and a deadline is negotiated between editor and contributor. Assignments are tracked in **"Section Notebooks"** -- there is one for each section. For typical turnarounds, see **"Deadlines"**.

### 3\. Preparation

During the time when an assignment is made and a finished story is expected, there is a certain amount of preparation by editor and contributor. The editor is expected to be aware of all pending stories, and quickly relay information that will affect the story to the writer. The editor should also be in contact with the Images editor to coordinate any additional photography or illustration.

Meanwhile, writers should be familiarizing themselves with the subject and in general preparing for the event, interview or review.

### 4\. Execution

The day of the interview. The night of the show. The time those reviews are due. Should something go wrong and things not go as planned, contributors need to contact their editors ASAP in order to reschedule, extend or otherwise try to resolve the situation.

### 5\. Submission

Once the contributor has finished their text or images, they post it to the corresponding editor, either via the online forms (in the case of text) or via email or other means to the Images Editor.

### 6\. First Pass

The editor receiving the text then proofs grammar, spelling and facts to the best of their abilities and makes sure text formatting (see **[Quick Tags](http://staff.ink19.com/docs/quickTags)**) is correct. If there are significant problems with a story, it may be sent back for corrections or a rewrite.

### 7\. Posting

The editor takes the corrected text and posts it to the Ink 19 production site.

### 8\. Proofing and Production

The **"Editorial Board"** performs additional proofing on stories, providing comments where necessary. The section editor adds images, keywords, cross references and other finishing touches to the text. For more on the publishing side of the web site, see **"edit.ink19.com"** and **"Macro Reference"**.

### 9\. Release and Scheduling

When the editor feels a story is ready to run, they release it. This adds it to the scheduling page, in the "Unscheduled" category. The editor-in-chief is in charge of assigning run dates and times to stories; if there are special requirements for a story (that is, run before, after or on a specific date), the section editor should notify the editor in chief.

### 10\. Publishing

At the specified date and time, the story goes live to the public site. The text becomes available on its own page, and the story may be referenced on the home page and/or other index pages.

### Appendix A: Notification

After this point, it is expected of both contributor and editor to notify corresponding contacts in industry, and for contributors to additionally promote stories to related sites.

### Appendix B: Maintenance

Sometimes typos and factual errors are reported after a story has been published. It is the responsibility of that section's editor to make sure these details are taken care of promptly.
