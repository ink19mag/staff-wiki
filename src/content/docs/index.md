Welcome to the Ink 19 staff wiki, perpetually in development! 

Links are in the right-side menu. The Editorial section is especially useful to new staff, if we do say so ourselves, and below are some highlights.

- [How to Ink 19](editorial)
- [Editing Manual](editorial/editing-manual) - grammar basics, commas, quotation marks, decades, italics, etc.
- [Formatting](editorial/formatting-quicktags) - quicktags, markdown, images
- [Photo Conventions](editorial/photos) - sizing, inserting in a story
- [Photography Tips](editorial/photography-tips) - how to photograph a show
- [Contact Ink 19](contact)
